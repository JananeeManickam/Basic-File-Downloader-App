# Basic-File-Downloader-App

This is a basic android applicationm that helps the users to download files. 
This is a basic level project level project which is yet to develop into a complete notes app.

The basic idea of this application is to have an android application tailored to educational purpose, where the faculty of a class would post any notes or files.
This file or notes can be downloaded by all the students to their mobiles.
This project uses firebase database, where in the developed version (yet to be developed) this datastore could only be accessible by the respective teachers. 
Notes/Files can be uploaded in the data store is now available in the mobile application for downloading. 

Currently, initial part of development is done, which is downloading the files/notes posted in firebase data store. 
Further, We need to organize the file system for multiple departments. Then we should also create User Interface for the faculties to upload their file into the data store. Also, we need to include authentication and authorization.
